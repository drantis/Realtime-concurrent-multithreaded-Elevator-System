## Assumption: 
  - The elevator takes about _a floor height_ to accelerate/decelerate.

## Max speed: 
  - `t` = (time travelled for 3 floors) - (time travelled for 2 floors)
        = 1.13 m/s

## Acceleration/Deceleration:
  - $\delta t = 5.43s$ 
  - $\delta v = v_2 = 1.13m/s$
  - $a = (1.13 m/s)/(5.43 s) = 0.21 m/s^2$

## The average loading time (s): 
  `f(x) = 1.5x + 8` where `x` is the number of passengers

## The average unloading time (s): 
  `f(x) = 1.1x + 7.7` where `x` is the number of passengers
